# rsspy

It's a simple RSS-reader which renders the harvested entries of the feeds either as a feed or as a chronological stream of entries.
In future it will allow personalisation and will offer a 'unread' view as well as a couple of other features.

As the name implies it's written in python and uses flask, jinja, feedparser, MySQLdb

a (sometimes) running example can be found at: http://rsspy.xiffy.nl/


RSS Feeds, maar dan helemaal anders

Because one day I created this: https://rss.xiffy.nl/ and it served me for over a decade with what was worthwhile on the internet. But it's getting old and runs PHP with deprecated mysqllibraries.

A complete rewrite features will be made up in the writing.

stay tuned ...
(off course you don't)
