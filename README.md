# rsspy

It's a simple RSS-reader which renders the harvested entries of the feeds either as a feed or as a chronological stream of entries.
In future it will allow personalisation and will offer a 'unread' view as well as a couple of other features.

As the name implies it's written in python and uses flask, jinja, feedparser, MySQLdb

a (sometimes) running example can be found at: http://rsspy.xiffy.nl/recent and http://rsspy.xiffy.nl/feed/20

RSS Feeds, maar dan helemaal anders

A complete rewrite features will be made up in the writing.

stay tuned ...
(off course you don't)

i transfered the one thing people care about https://rss.xiffy.nl/foksuk.php it's python but cool uri's don't change.
