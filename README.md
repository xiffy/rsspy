# rsspy

It's a simple RSS-reader which caches subscribed feeds locally and renders the harvested entries of the feeds either as [a feed](https://rss.xiffy.nl/feed/20/xml) or as [a chronological stream of entries](https://rss.xiffy.nl/feed/20).

Logged in users (account creation is lacking) have extra options:
  - create bokmarks,
  - create groups or lists of related feeds which have their [own output](https://rss.xiffy.nl/group/3).
  - have digested groups emailed to you

As the name implies it's written in python and uses flask, jinja, feedparser, sqlite

a (sometimes) running example can be found at: http://rsspy.xiffy.nl/recent and http://rsspy.xiffy.nl/feed/20

RSS Feeds, maar dan helemaal anders

stay tuned ...
(off course you don't)

i transfered the one thing people care about https://rss.xiffy.nl/foksuk.php it's python but cool uri's don't change.
